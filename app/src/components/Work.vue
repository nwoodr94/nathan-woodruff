    <p>
      I'm a software engineer at the Idaho National Laboratory, a US Department
      of Energy facility.
      <br />
      At the lab, I build applications that enable researchers to do novel and
      interesting things with nuclear reactors.
      <br />
      I'm a full-stack developer, and so I do everything from apps to servers,
      and containers to clouds.
      <br />
      This work involves research, and I've authored papers on data warehouses,
      and blockchains.
