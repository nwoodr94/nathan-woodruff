    <p>
      I'm a software engineer at the Idaho National Laboratory, a US Department
      of Energy facility.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the lab, I build applications that enable researchers to do novel and
      interesting things with nuclear reactors.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a full-stack developer, and so I do everything from apps to servers,
      and containers to clouds.
