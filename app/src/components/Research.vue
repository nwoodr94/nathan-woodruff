    <p>
      My research is supported in part through my position at the Idaho National
      Laboratory. My most recent research is focused on the area of
      <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/" target="_blank"
        >blockchains</a
      >.
      <br />
      I'm interested in demonstrating how both public and private laboratories
      can better utilize slack computational resources to make use of
      blockchains and generate returns.
