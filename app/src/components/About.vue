    <h3 class="secondary--text">About Me</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      I'm into science, fitness, nature, and I'm very involved with my church.
      <br />
      Originally from the Pacific Northwest, I graduated from the University of
      Washington in 2017 with a Bachelor's degree in Applied Physics.
      <br />
      I first learned to code as an undergraduate researcher, programming
      microcontrollers on sounding rockets. I was interested in plotting flight
      trajectories, and in learning about sensors like accelerometers and
      gyroscopes,

        >my first language was C.</a

      <br />
      Before becoming an engineer, I spent two years turning wrenches on the
      outskirts of Austin, TX for a semiconductor tooling manufacturer.
