    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm native to the Pacific Northwest, and I graduated from the University of Washington with a B.S. in Applied
        Physics in 2017.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the summer of 2019 I completed a full-stack software development bootcamp, and due to my affinity for web applications and year-long sunshine, I started work as a software developer in Los Angeles.
      </p>
      <h2>Software Development</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a software developer at Southern California Edison in Los Angeles. SCE provides electricity to 14 million people in the Southern California region.
        <br />
        <br />
        I like to traverse the whole stack throughout the course of a typical sprint. 
        <br />
        <br />
        That means I code both front- and back-end features and modules in React and Node, integrate third party APIs, script in Python and SQL, deploy applications on AWS, and implement DevOps utilities to automate important tasks. 
        <br />
        <br />
        I write clean code for my company.
      </p>
      <h2>My Website</h2>
      <p>
        This website is developed in React, and hosted on AWS. All requests to this domain are handled by Route 53, and passed through CloudFront before landing in an S3 bucket.
        <br />
        <br />
        The contact form submits information to a Flask server running on an EC2 instance. The form data is parsed on the backend and loaded into a SQLite database.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm using Elastic Beanstalk to manage the infrastructure configuration, networking, and security essentials needed to host this application.
        <br />
        <br />
        I collect form submissions from this site by securely posting a credential to the endpoint with cURL, in effect calling a function that returns my contacts.
      </p>
      <h2>Machine Preferences</h2>
      <p>
        I'm developing on a Pixelbook Go, with the i5/8/128G configuration. I like the abstract-everything
        philosophy of Chrome OS, but when it's time to code, I fire up the terminal and work directly in the provisioned Debian Linux
        container.
      </p>
      <h2>Lifestyle</h2>
      <p>
        I train with a crossfit gym, explore the outdoors, and learn a new skill as frequently as possible.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the future I'd like to fund my own research in space propulsion. I want to
        start my own business, and explore the west in an old Toyota 4Runner.
      </p>
      <h2>My Programming Story</h2>
      <p>
        This is the Space Daemon, a multiple-stage sounding rocket launched and recovered in the Black Rock Desert, NV.
        <br />
        <br />
        I first learned to code by programming a C script that collected data from sensors on its payload.
